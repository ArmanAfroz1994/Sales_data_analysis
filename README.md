# Sales_data_analysis

I have developed a visually appealing, user friendly, and perceptive Microsoft Power BI dashboard for "Sales Data Analysis." 👨🏻‍💻💰

Purpose: A deep dive into sales data, aimed at extracting valuable insights to enhance strategic decision-making. Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making. 🛍🔝 

following are the data analysis technique that are used in this project:

1. Data Cleaning - To remove unnecessary, undesirable, and unambiguous data that may have an impact on the project's analysis. 🗃🗂

2. Data Transformation: To prevent erroneous or incomplete analysis and to preserve inconsistencies, determine the kind of data for each column and merge the data into a single format. 🔁⏳

3. Data Visualization: Using Power BI components such as Area Charts, Slicers, Bar Charts, and other visual aids, convey the meaningful information. It is a means of streamlining the data and presenting to the final user the important business-related information. 📊💡

What will you discover from this analysis?

🎯 Dealers can identify product patterns in terms of profit margins and products sold on a specific day, month, and year. 

🎯 Dealers can also use the "Map" builder graphic to track sales in a certain city, area, or location. 

🎯 Shop owners can also learn about the best and worst-selling products. 

The shop owners can make more profitable decisions by using the data analysis to support and guide their decision-making. 📶🛄
